MONOLITHIC    : Single server multiple services single DB.
MICRO SERVICE : Multiple servers Multiple services with multiple DB's

how to select the architecture: Based on application and its services.

in Micro services we dont use servers, we use Containers.


Container: is a Virtual Machine without OS.
Docker: its a tool used to create Container.
Image: consist of os & packages which are already installed.

server = Vm = conatiner

Docker: 

It is an open source centralized platform designed to create, deploy and run applications.
Docker is written in the Go language.
Docker creates containers on host O.S to run applications. (computer/server os)
We can install Docker on any O.S but the docker engine runs natively on Linux distribution.
It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual O.S.
Before Docker Docker performs O.S level Virtualization also known as Containerization.
process of packing application along with its dependencies.
many users face problems that a particular code is running in the developerâ€™s system but not in the user system.
It was initially released in March 2013, and developed by Solomon Hykes and Sebastian Pahl.
Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service that use O.S level Virtualization, where as VM ware uses Hardware level Virtualization.
Container have O.S files but its negligible in size compared to original files of that O.S.


COMPONENTS:

CLIENT: It takes the commands and executes with communication docker daemon
HOST: The place where you installed docker.
DAEMON: Deals with docker componets(images, containers, volumes ----). it is inside docker host.
REGISTRY: It stores all the Images.

============================================

DAY-02:
Installation:
yum install docker -y
systemctl restart docker.service
systemctl status docker.service
docker version

DOCKER COMMANDS:

docker pull ubuntu: to get ubuntu image from registry
docker images : to list the images 
docker run ubuntu : to create a conatiners
docker ps -a  : to list all the containers
docker ps : to list running containers only
docker run --name raham1 ubuntu : to give the name for container
docker run -it --name raham2 ubuntu : to go inside of a container
cat /etc/os-release : to see the flavour of linux

inside container: note: in ubuntu pkg manager is apt (advance package tool)
apt update -y
apt install maven -y
apt install mysql-server -y
mkdir raham & touch abc.txt
raham2 (cont) -- > install maven,mysql db & files -- > image form container -- > image

os level of virtualization --- > content inside the os will be on image now

ctrl p q : to exit from container

docker commit raham2 swiggy:v1     : to create image from container

====================================================================================

DOCKER FILE: 
It is an automated method to create docker images.
in docker file D must be captial.
in single folder we need to have only one docker file.
docker file will have some componets inside it.
each component is on CAPITAL letter.

write Docker file -- > Build -- > Image
