MONOLITHIC    : Single server multiple services single DB.
MICRO SERVICE : Multiple servers Multiple services with multiple DB's

how to select the architecture: Based on application and its services.

in Micro services we dont use servers, we use Containers.


Container: is a Virtual Machine without OS.
Docker: its a tool used to create Container.
Image: consist of os & packages which are already installed.

server = Vm = conatiner

Docker: 

It is an open source centralized platform designed to create, deploy and run applications.
Docker is written in the Go language.
Docker creates containers on host O.S to run applications. (computer/server os)
We can install Docker on any O.S but the docker engine runs natively on Linux distribution.
It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual O.S.
Before Docker Docker performs O.S level Virtualization also known as Containerization.
process of packing application along with its dependencies.
many users face problems that a particular code is running in the developerâ€™s system but not in the user system.
It was initially released in March 2013, and developed by Solomon Hykes and Sebastian Pahl.
Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service that use O.S level Virtualization, where as VM ware uses Hardware level Virtualization.
Container have O.S files but its negligible in size compared to original files of that O.S.


COMPONENTS:

CLIENT: It takes the commands and executes with communication docker daemon
HOST: The place where you installed docker.
DAEMON: Deals with docker componets(images, containers, volumes ----). it is inside docker host.
REGISTRY: It stores all the Images.
